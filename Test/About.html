    <h1>Zack's Web Browser</h1>
    <br />
    This is my lightweight browser, designed for basic functionality minus waiting times and tabs etc.<br />
    I don't have any debugging or anything, it shouldn't crash <i>that</i> often.<br />
    Don't have much to say in the ways of troubleshooting. My browser can't even save passwords so good luck having anything important going when it crashes.<br />
    If you want to help me out check out the repo on <a href="http://www.github.com/zaxophone">my Github</a><br />
    Have a nice day.<br />
    <br />
    Zack<br />
